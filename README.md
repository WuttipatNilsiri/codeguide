1.  Follow the Style Guide
	correct indent your code for every programming language
	where to put spaces and braces, how to name stuff, how to comment.
	```
	for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) {
	```
	
	
2.  Create Descriptive Names
	Use long descriptive names, like complementSpanLength, to help yourself, now and in the future,
	as well as your colleagues to understand what the code does
	```
	sumFibobaciNumber
	```
